## 1. Purpose

This document defines the coding standards and repository structure for the project. It aims to improve code quality, readability, maintainability, and team collaboration.

## 2. File Structure Overview

The repository uses a GitFlow branching model. See "[GitHub Contributions](#github-contributions)" section for branching policies.

Typical file structure:

```
üìÇ BRAD
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ api/                 # backend and data storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ backend/             # backend and data storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ bot/                 # Used to analyze reports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ frontend/            # UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ docs/                # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ README.md            # Project overview
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ docker-compose.yml   # Docker setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ .gitignore           # Ignore unnecessary files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ .dockerignore        # Ignore unnecessary files
```

## 3. Coding Conventions

### 3.1 Naming Conventions

| Element   | Convention       | Example            |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Classes   | PascalCase       | `UserProfile`      |
| Variables | camelCase        | `userName`         |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_USERS`        |
| Functions | camelCase        | `calculateScore()` |
| Files     | kebab-case       | `user-profile.cpp` |

### 3.2 Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Limit lines to 100 characters.
- Braces on new lines for classes and functions.
- One space between control statements and ():

Example:

```python
if (condition) {
    doSomething();
}
```

### 3.3 In-code Commenting

Use `//` for short comments and `/* ... */` for block comments.

Every function and complex logic block must have a comment explaining purpose or reasoning.

Example:

```python
// Calculate total score based on weights and penalties
int totalScore = baseScore + bonus - penalty;
```

## 4. Responsibilities

Clear responsibilities are assigned to ensure coding standards are followed:

- Developers: Apply these standards while writing code.
- Reviewers: Ensure code adheres to standards before approving.
- Team Leads: Train team members and ensure adherence.

## 5. Justification for Standards

Using coding standards:

- Enhances code readability and team collaboration
- Ensures consistent formatting and structure
- Makes integration and testing easier
- Improves tool compatibility (e.g., Doxygen, linters)
- Simplifies onboarding of new developers

## 6. Guidelines for Practice

To successfully implement these standards:

- Document work early to avoid overhead.
- Involve all developers in standard design and updates.
- Review and update standards as the project evolves.
- Use tools (e.g., linters, formatters, CI) to enforce rules automatically.

## Branching Strategy

We will be making use of a **GitFlow-based branching strategy**, with a layout that looks as follows:

```sh
-> main
    -> dev
        -> ui
        -> docs
        -> api
        -> docker-container
            -> derived branch A
        -> ai-bot
            -> derived branch B
```

### Follow the Chain (VERY IMPORTANT)

Please:

```sh
> ‚ùå DO NOT COMMIT TO MAIN/DEV
> ‚ùå DO NOT MERGE TO MAIN/DEV
> ‚ùå DO NOT BRANCH FROM MAIN/DEV
```

### Explaining main and dev:

- **main** is our production branch that should always be in a working condition. Direct changes that do not follow our branching strategy can introduce issues on the version that other people might see.

- **dev** is the branch where all other branch additions are combined into an almost working state. In this branch all _minor_ bugs and integrations are fixed before sending to main.

Our **dedicated DevOps team-member** will be managing these two branches and taking all new changes from the respective **feature branches** through dev to main.

---

## Creating Branches

Each person is allowed to create personal/feature branches, as long as:

- They branch off one of the **feature branches**.
- The branches are created from an **Issue**. See the Issues section below if you are unsure how to do this.
- They **use issues to create the branch**. This will help the DevOps team manage everything.

---

## Deleting Branches

When you‚Äôre done with an issue and it has been merged, you can select the option to delete the branch along with closing the issue.

Otherwise, if you wish to unassign yourself from the issue, you may delete the branch and update the project board **without closing the issue** to do so.

---

## Merging and Pull Requests

### When to Merge

Before making a pull request, you should **merge the feature branch** you are branching from into your current branch.

Use the command:

```bash
git pull origin <branchname>
```
