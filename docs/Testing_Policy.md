## Introduction

This document outlines the testing policy for the BRAD system, covering Frontend, Backend (API), and Bot testing.

## Purpose

Define the approach, scope, and guidelines for testing the BRAD system.

## Objectives

* Ensure functional correctness of all components.
* Verify security and compliance requirements.
* Assess reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
* Validate usability and overall quality.

## Testing Process

### Unit Testing

Test individual modules or components in isolation for correct functionality.

### Integration Testing

Verify that different components (Bot, API, frontend) work together as expected.

### Automation and CI Pipeline

Describe automated tests integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

## Quality Assurance Metrics and Testing

The BRAD system's top 5 quality requirements, listed from most important to least important:

### Security

Test authentication, authorization, input validation, and endpoint security.

### Compliance

Ensure the system meets regulatory, legal, and internal policy requirements.

### Reliability

Ensure system stability under consistent usage.

### Scalability

Check system behavior under increasing load and user concurrency.

### Maintainability

Assess the ease of system updates, code readability, and long-term upkeep.

## Frontend Testing (UI Testing)

Test user interface components for correctness, usability, and integration with backend services.

## Backend Testing (API Testing)

Test all API endpoints for functionality, security, reliability, and performance.

## Bot Testing

Test the Bot module for functional correctness, security, and integration with API and frontend.

## Tools Used

* **Postman**: Functional and security testing of APIs.
* **Swagger UI**: API endpoint verification.
* **JMeter**: Reliability and scalability/load testing.
* **VS Code / Notepad**: Editing test scripts and documentation.
* **Browser Dev Tools**: Frontend testing and debugging.

## Conclusion

The testing of the BRAD system ensures that the application meets its top quality requirements and that individual components (Frontend, Backend, Bot) operate
