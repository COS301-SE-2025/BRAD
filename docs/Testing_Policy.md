## Introduction

The BRAD system automates the investigation of suspicious domains, securely collecting and analyzing content to detect threats. Centralized reporting and dashboards provide insight for effective incident analysis.

## Purpose

This Testing Policy defines the processes, objectives and strategies required to ensure that the BRAD system functions correctly, remains secure and delivers a reliable and high-quality experience. It establishes a clear framework for testing all components including the Bot, API and frontend, ensuring that suspicious domain reports are accurately analyzed, centralized dashboards operate effectively and the system consistently meets its top quality requirements.

## Objectives

The objectives of this Testing Policy are to identify and address all potential scenarios and edge cases that may arise within the BRAD system. This ensures that the Bot, API, and frontend components can correctly handle user submissions of suspicious domains, analyze and process content securely, and maintain accurate reporting in the dashboards. By implementing robust validation, error handling, and recovery strategies, the BRAD system will operate reliably, securely, and efficiently, providing investigators with consistent and trustworthy threat analysis.

## Testing Process
Our team employs Jest, MongoDB Memory Server, SuperTest, Nodemailer Mock, Pytest, Pytest-Cov, Docker Compose (test services), Dramatic Stubbroker, and React Testing Library as the primary testing tools to conduct unit and integration tests for the BRAD system. These tools ensure comprehensive coverage of individual components (Bot, API, frontend) and their interactions across the system. For automation and consistency, GitHub Actions serves as the continuous integration (CI) pipeline, ensuring all tests are executed before code merges into the main branch. For non-functional testing of reliability, scalability, and security, we use JMeter and Swagger UI. Our goal is to achieve thorough test coverage to ensure the system meets its top quality requirements.

### Unit Testing

For unit testing:

Backend/API: Jest, MongoDB Memory Server, SuperTest, and Nodemailer Mock verify that each function, service, and endpoint behaves as expected in isolation.

Bot: Pytest, Pytest-Cov, Docker Compose (test services), and Dramatic Stubbroker test the botâ€™s functionality and integration with system services.

Frontend: React Testing Library and Jest validate individual UI components and interactions.

These tools provide immediate feedback on any issues, ensuring that each component works correctly before integration with other modules.

### Integration Testing

Integration testing for the BRAD system ensures that the Bot, API and frontend components work together correctly when processing suspicious domain reports. We use Jest with SuperTest for API integration, Pytest with Docker Compose and Dramatic Stubbroker for the Bot, and React Testing Library with Jest for frontend interactions.

These tests simulate real-world workflows, such as a user submitting a suspicious URL, the bot analyzing the content, and the results being displayed correctly in the dashboards. Integration tests include both live tests, which interact with actual services and databases, and mocked tests, which simulate external dependencies. Mocked tests are particularly useful for handling scenarios like network issues, malware detection failures, or bot service interruptions without relying on live external resources.

### Automation and CI Pipeline

Describe automated tests integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

## Quality Assurance Metrics and Testing

The BRAD system's top 5 quality requirements, listed from most important to least important:

### Security

Test authentication, authorization, input validation, and endpoint security.

### Compliance

Ensure the system meets regulatory, legal, and internal policy requirements.

### Reliability

Ensure system stability under consistent usage.

### Scalability

Check system behavior under increasing load and user concurrency.

### Maintainability

Assess the ease of system updates, code readability, and long-term upkeep.

## Frontend Testing (UI Testing)

Test user interface components for correctness, usability, and integration with backend services.

## Backend Testing (API Testing)

Test all API endpoints for functionality, security, reliability, and performance.

## Bot Testing

Test the Bot module for functional correctness, security, and integration with API and frontend.

## Tools Used

* **Postman**: Functional and security testing of APIs.
* **Swagger UI**: API endpoint verification.
* **JMeter**: Reliability and scalability/load testing.
* **VS Code / Notepad**: Editing test scripts and documentation.
* **Browser Dev Tools**: Frontend testing and debugging.

## Conclusion

The testing of the BRAD system ensures that the application meets its top quality requirements and that individual components (Frontend, Backend, Bot) operate
